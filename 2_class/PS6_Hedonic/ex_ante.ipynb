In this case, the model's coefficients may be interpreted as the implicit price of each characteristic. Hedonic price models can be useful for estimating the price of characteristics for which there are no markets. For example, we do not observe a price for clean air, but we may be able to estimate the (implicit) price effect of clean air on house prices.\n",

For each apartment, we observe the sales price and a range of apartment characteristics which are all specific to the year of 2005. We consider these data as a cross-section, exploiting variation in prices and characteristics across apartments to estimate the parameters of the hedonic price regression.\n",
